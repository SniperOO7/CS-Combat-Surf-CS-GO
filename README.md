## Free vs. Full version
- plugin is only for CS:GO/CS:S (not everything work in CS:S, you have to count with it)
- free version (old/demo version) can be find in sourcemod, it's not updated and old
- [full version](https://github.com/SniperOO7/VIP-Premium-FULL-VERSION/wiki/Full-version) (new version) you can get by buying it from me [Click here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sniper-oo7/)
- Warning!
     - Many people writing me about the plugin with expectation that plugin will cost under 10 €, it's huge project with 2 years of updating and many features, such a huge projects cost more than 10 € and you need to count with it
     - Full version cost around **+- 20 €**, it's a normal price for such a huge plugin.
